# Reimbursements App project

<!-- Project BIO -->
This application is made to be used in a professional environment, where employees and managers can request reimbursements for job related things. Employees and managers can login, see and change their personal info(such as name, username, and password), and also submit reimbursement requests. Managers have additional features that are only available for them, such as vieweing all employees, changing any employee's information, accepting and denying employee's reimbursement requests.

This application displays some of my skills with:

- Full MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- User authentication (Employee vs Manager views)
- Use of GET/POST Request methods
- Oracle Database query
- JSP/JSTL use for dynamic web pages
