<!-- Technology welcome message -->
C# was the first language that taught me object oriented programming more in-depth. During some of my classes at Florida State University, I created a lot of console apps from scratch, or would backwards engineer some other example given to me. Most of these apps utilize object oriented programming key concepts such as data encapsulation, abstraction of functionality, attribute and methods inheritance, and basic polymorphism.

<!-- Project section -->
<h2><a href="https://github.com/lgc13/LucasCosta_portfolio/tree/master/c%23/CreateRoom_objectCalculator_project">1- Create Room Calculator</a></h2>

<!-- Project BIO -->
This application creates different "Room" objects, by asking user input for information such as a Room name, length, width, and height. Afterwards, methods are called in order to return attribute values about this Room, such as its name, area, volume in cubed feet and in cubed yards. It also provides information about a default Room (from default constructor properties.)

This application displays some of my skills with:

- polymorphism: method overloading
- encapsulation: keeping private data hidden
- abstraction: calling methods from a class in a separate file
- use of default constructor, getter and setter methods
- mathematical algorithms

<!-- Code explanation -->
"BRIEF TALK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING CODE SNIPPET:"

<!-- Code snippet -->
You can see that in this code snippet:

```c#

public void SetLength(double l = 0.0)
{ //setter method
  this.roomLength = l;
}

public void SetWidth(double w = 0.0)
{ //setter method
  this.roomWidth = w;
}

public void SetHeight(double h = 0.0)
{ //setter method
  this.roomHeight = h;
}


roomObject2.SetLength(rLength);
roomObject2.SetWidth(rWidth);
roomObject2.SetHeight(rHeight);

```

Although these were my biggest projects with C#, I have worked on a lot of other smaller projects, practice problems and trivia questions. You can see these by clicking this link:
