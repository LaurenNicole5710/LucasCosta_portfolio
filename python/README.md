<!-- Technology welcome message -->
Python is one of the main technologies that I use. One of my best friends, Chris, introduced me to this easy syntax, object oriented programming language during my studies at Florida State University. I really enjoy Python, given how easy, clean, and intuitive it is. I also prefer to use Python whenever I work on any of my personal projects.

Currently, I am working on expanding my skills by creating a full stack application with Flask, and Django. Also, I teach Python at LaunchCode, a non-profit organization that focuses on teaching programming skills to people who have never done it before.
