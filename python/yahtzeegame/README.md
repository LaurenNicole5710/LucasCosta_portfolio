# Yahtzee Game project

<!-- Project BIO -->
This is a console application that allows users to play Yahtzee, a fun game where they can roll dice and add up points. The game starts off asking for the amount of players, and allows each to input their own name. Afterwards, each player can take turns rolling the dice up to 3 times, being able to edit them at any point. At the end of the turn, that player's points are added up to their total. The person with the highest points, win!

I worked on this project with 2 other team mates, Sasha Larson and Devesh.
