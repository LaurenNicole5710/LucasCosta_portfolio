This directory holds some projects and practice examples that I worked on through native Android Studio.

I created some android phone applications that utilized features such as radio buttons, images, and avatar emoticons.

[1- My Business Card App](https://github.com/lgc13/LucasCosta_portfolio/tree/master/android_studio/MyBusinessCard_app_project)

Using Android Studio, I created a small 2 pages app which uses avatar emoticons, picture imports and radio buttons. Upon clicking the "Details" radio button, this link will display the second page which displays some plain text with some of my contact info.

[2- Bruschetta Recipe App](https://github.com/lgc13/LucasCosta_portfolio/tree/master/android_studio/Recipe_app_project)

This was the first phone app that I made with Android Studio. I learned how to create a basic user interface using pictures, buttons, and different font texts.

Although these were my biggest projects with Android Studio, I have worked on quite a lot more smaller projects, practice problems and trivia questions. You can see these by clicking this link:
