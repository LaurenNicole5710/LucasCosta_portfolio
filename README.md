As of August 2018, I decided to revamp my entire portfolio onto a single centralized GitHub Monorepository! This accomplishes 2 huge goals that I've had:

1. Showcase
  - displaying all my projects all around (summary, uses, code snippets, code explanation, screenshots)
  (I can easily put new projects for display, and remove older ones from the spotlight)

2. Organization
  - subdividing directories by the main technology/language used
  (I can easily look back and find any previous projects and practice examples)
