### Monorepository Portfolio

Thanks for checking out my Github account! As of August 2018, I decided to revamp my entire portfolio onto a single centralized GitHub Monorepository! This allows me to:

1. Easily showcase (and remove from showcase) any of my projects, including their summaries, concepts, code snippets, code explanation, and screenshots.
2. Organize projects by subdividing their directories by the main technology/language used so that I can easily find it at a later time.

That should make browsing through my project/directories fairly intuitive. Here's the layout that I created for this repo:

```sh

LucasCosta_portfolio
├── android_studio
│   └── project#
│   └── practice
├── c#
│   └── project#
│   └── practice
├── c++
│   └── project#
│   └── practice
├── java
│   └── project#
│   └── practice
├── python
│   └── project#
│   └── practice
└── web_dev
    └── project#
    └── practice

```

Each folder holds the biggest projects that I've done with that specific technology right inside its directory. There is also a 'practice' folder which has all other project/example exercises that I've done with said language.

I am enthusiastic, adaptive, responsible and hardworking. I strive at using my life and work experiences to plan ahead for any possible future challenges, as well as properly handling any current ongoing problems that I encounter. I enjoy investing time in learning and research, as new breakthroughs do not happen on their own.

As a Software engineer, I have used quite a lot of tools/technologies for an application's client side, server side, and infrastructure. For example:

- Infrastructure: Jenkins, IBM UrbanCode Deploy, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Weblogic, Websphere, JBoss
- Web Frameworks: Spring MVC, Hibernate, Apache Tomcat
- Development: Python, Java, C#, and C++, JSP, PHP
- Database: MySQL, Oracle
- Front end: AngularJS, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS
- Others: Git, SVN, Bash, Unix, Jira

I have also worked as a computer technician, and I have a lot of experience with overall computer hardware, repairs, and upgrades.

Lastly, I am a very motivated individual who has held many leadership roles (such as a manager, assistant-manager, senior technician, and team leader) in previous jobs. I enjoy taking on responsibility and seeing progress all the way through.
